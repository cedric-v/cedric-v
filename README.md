## 🛠️ Product Engineering & Systems

I don't just write code; I build **frictionless paths**. As a Product Engineer, I step into the user's shoes to solve business problems with technical elegance.

### ⚡ Modern Web Development (Next.js & Jamstack)
I build high-performance, secure, and eco-friendly static sites that load instantly and require zero maintenance.
- **Stack:** Nunjucks, Firebase, Eleventy (11ty). I rely on Modern CSS for lean, maintainable interfaces—prioritizing performance over framework bloat.
- **Philosophy:** Performance as a feature. If it doesn't need a server, it shouldn't have one.

### Backend & Data 
For applications requiring robust data management and real-time capabilities, I implement Supabase to ensure a scalable and secure architecture.

### 🤖 Workflow Automation (Node.js & Deno)
I automate the repetitive to free up human creativity. I specialize in identifying friction in business processes and eliminating it through code.
- **Stack:** Python, TypeScript, Google Apps Script.
- **CI/CD:** Heavy use of **GitHub Actions** to automate deployments and data flows (as seen in my [fluance-io](https://github.com/cedric-v/fluance-io) repo).

### Strategic & Process Audits
I use my marketing background to ensure every technical decision serves a business objective, focusing on Growth Hacking, conversion, and process efficiency.

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">America was discovered because the passage to India was blocked.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Or how to turn a constraint into an opportunity. 🌟</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Remember your history lessons: America was discovered by Europeans because the silk and spice routes were blocked by the Ottoman Empire.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It is thanks to this difficult situation that expeditions to find new access routes have been financed.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">You know the rest: everyone has heard the name Christopher Columbus, centuries later.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">As it happens, the same applies to the life of a company.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">The most difficult times are fertile ground for new momentum.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Sometimes back to basics, other times pivoting.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">I've experienced it many times over the years. So have several of my contractor customers.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">The first step is to realize that your business is going through a delicate phase.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">The second is often to slow down, step back and take stock.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Then identify possible new paths.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Does it speak to you?</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Then the tips I'll be sharing twice a month in my newsletter may be relevant to you.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">They are also useful in difficult times, when you need to adjust your business to suit you, while keeping it simple and effective.</p>

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Yes, it's on the house.</p>

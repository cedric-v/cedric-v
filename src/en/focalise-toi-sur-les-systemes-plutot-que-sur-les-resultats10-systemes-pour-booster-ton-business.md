Contact 10 new people a day > aim to sell 1 program a day. 3. Automate the filing of receipts > try to stay up to date on admin. 4. Create a weekly learning routine > aim for expertise. 5. Track and optimize your key metrics every month > focus on a specific ROI. 6. Organize regular feedback sessions with your team > aim for improved customer satisfaction. 7. Plan your quarterly milestones and associated actions > aim for annual sales. 8. Test a new version of your ads every week (A/B testing) > try to improve them continuously. 9. Improve your offer at every launch > aim for perfection from the start. 10.

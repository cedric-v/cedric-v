          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">At the end of each day, identify and write down the <strong>3 most important things</strong> to do on your next working day. When the time comes, do them. Well done. 👏</p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">If you then try new things and spread yourself too thin, that's OK. If you have urgent things to do, that's OK. If you're interrupted, it's OK. <strong>You've already done what you needed to do to make your working day a success.</strong> Do it again for the next day.</p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">If an action takes <strong>less than 2 minutes</strong> to complete, do it immediately. Don't write it down: writing it down and coming back to it later will take you longer than doing it right away.</p>

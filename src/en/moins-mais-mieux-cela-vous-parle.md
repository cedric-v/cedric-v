      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">How about saying <strong>STOP</strong> to being visible everywhere, all the time? This frantic race to be visible at all costs leads above all to... <strong>overwork</strong>. 😩</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Some of my clients and acquaintances have set up systems and a team to achieve this. If your business can afford it and it works for you, then great. Carry on.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">If, on the other hand, you're doing everything yourself and want to promote efficiency, then <strong>focus on one traffic source at a time</strong>.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It's better to have <strong>1 optimized acquisition channel that works well</strong>, than several that don't work at all.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Take the time to answer a few fundamental questions:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
        <li>What message do you want to broadcast? With what intent?</li>
        <li>Where are most of your potential customers located?</li>
        <li>What formats do you prefer to create (text, images, video, audio)?</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Then choose your acquisition channel. This could be a social network, but also advertising, partnerships, etc.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE]">1 offer + 1 acquisition channel, then optimize.</p>

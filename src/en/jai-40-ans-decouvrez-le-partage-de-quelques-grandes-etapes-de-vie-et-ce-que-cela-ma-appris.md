<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">I'm 40 today. 🎂 This is an opportunity to share a few major life milestones and what they've taught me. 👇 A) Entrepreneur since the age of 12, with a video game website, hand-coded in HTML (in notepad and with Netscape Navigator for those who remember). 💡: It's possible to get paid for passing on what you love. 🥳 B) Trained as a computer engineer, then a decade in directly related professions. 💡: Structuring one's thinking is very useful for understanding logic and moving forward efficiently. C) Long-term travel is a school of life (a year in Asia then elsewhere at other times, over 45 countries visited). 💡: Every human being has the same basic needs, beyond his or her culture and upbringing. It seems obvious, but it's done me good to see it time and time again. D) Married 💡: Complementarity drives inner growth. It's a virtuous circle. ❣️ E) Dad of 2. 💡: Hyper demanding, but there's no better way to bring back into the present moment and become aware of what's essential. ✨ F) Founder of my company. 💡: The key to freedom. It's great to be able to choose every day what I do and with whom, even if the ups and downs aren't always easy to manage. Entrepreneurship is probably the best way to develop lots of skills in parallel and at high speed. Perseverance is probably the most decisive factor in staying the course over the long term. That's all for now. I'm off to celebrate. 🎉 I wish you a pleasant day. ☀</p>

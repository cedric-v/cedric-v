      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">4 strengths of this approach, with their advantages and disadvantages👇</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">With external financing more difficult than ever before, self-financing the <a href="{{ '/en/tout-va-trop-vite-les-dangers-de-lhypercroissance/' | relativeUrl }}" class="text-[#0A6BCE] hover:underline">growth</a> of one's structure has become even more important. In this spirit of freedom and agility, I particularly appreciate the "solopreneurship" model. In fact, I've been applying it for over 12 years, long before the name was popularized. 😁</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Here are the strengths and weaknesses of this model ⛵️:</p>

      <div class="space-y-6">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0f172a] mb-3">🎯 Targeted delegation</h3>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">Entrust recurring tasks to a small team of freelancers hyper-qualified in their respective fields.</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li><strong>+</strong> Good workload flexibility</li>
            <li><strong>-</strong> Not always easy to guarantee high responsiveness and coordinate everything when people are working on several projects at the same time for other customers. This requires certain processes to be established and good communication to be maintained.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0f172a] mb-3">⏩ Velocity</h3>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">Create new offers quickly and test them directly with the market for rapid validation.</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li><strong>+</strong> No or little hierarchy and a minimalist structure means you can be hyper-reactive</li>
            <li><strong>-</strong> There's no "coffee effect", i.e. informal discussions that solve certain worries just by exchanging points of view. Hence the need to organize occasional exchanges with people from other structures, with different perspectives and backgrounds.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0f172a] mb-3">🦾 Automation</h3>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">Using technology to automate everything that can be automated without losing the added value and <a href="{{ '/en/avez-vous-clairement-identifie-votre-unicite-et-celle-de-votre-activitebusiness/' | relativeUrl }}" class="text-[#0A6BCE] hover:underline">uniqueness</a> of your offering.</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li><strong>+</strong> Increasingly easy and quick to set up</li>
            <li><strong>-</strong> Be careful not to get lost. Sometimes, the cost of a good implementation is high in relation to the gains. Hence the importance of sorting out the essentials beforehand.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0f172a] mb-3">🔹 Specialized expertise</h3>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">Bring high added value thanks to clear, specialized expertise in your field of activity.</p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
            <li><strong>+</strong> Hyperspecialization enables you to stand out from the crowd in order to reach new customers, and then extend your range of offerings to already satisfied customers.</li>
            <li><strong>-</strong> Without having clearly identified your uniqueness, it's easy to find yourself "drowned in the crowd", with a vague offer or positioning that speaks to everyone... and to no one sufficiently to make a real decision to change.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

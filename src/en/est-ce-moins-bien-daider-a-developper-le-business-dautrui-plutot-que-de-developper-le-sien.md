      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">First I developed my own business, for years. 📈 Then entrepreneurs came to me to ask me to help them implement elements I had already realized:</p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg leading-relaxed ml-4">
        <li>➡ a small, self-managed freelance team</li>
        <li>➡ some uncommon automation</li>
        <li>➡ attractive offers</li>

        <li>➡ direct e-mail marketing whose frequency adjusts according to the person's interactivities, and so on.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">I took on a few clients, each time feeling guilty that I wasn't spending that time <a href="{{ '/en/accompagnement/individuel/' | relativeUrl }}" class="text-[#0A6BCE] hover:underline">developing my own business</a>. 🙈</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">💡 <strong>Until something clicked.</strong> I suddenly realized that helping an individual or a company to take its place and better disseminate what it does is just as respectable.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">On one condition: <strong>that I truly appreciate its mission and the way it contributes to it.</strong></p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Have you ever experienced this kind of inner conflict?</p>

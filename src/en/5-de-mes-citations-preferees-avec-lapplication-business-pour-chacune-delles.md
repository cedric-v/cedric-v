<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">🍎 "Think Different" It's by having contact with other industries and expertise that "revelations" are most easily brought to light. When I write the word revelation, I'm referring to "game-changing" improvements (as opposed to incremental improvements). 🤪 "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result." - Albert Einstein When something doesn't work, another approach needs to be tested. ☯ "Be water, my friend." The path of least resistance is often relevant. When your approach works, ride the wave and enjoy! 🚀 "Good enough" The English version of "Done is better than perfect" or how to move forward quickly then improve what works, rather than seeking illusory perfection that slows things down. 🪷 "How you do anything is how you do everything." In everything we do, attitude is everything. It's what makes the difference in the medium to long term between what's sustainable and what's less so... What's your favorite quote? Do you have another that comes to mind?</p>

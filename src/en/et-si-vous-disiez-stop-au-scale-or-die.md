      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">What if there were other ways of building a sustainable business <strong>AND one that suited you</strong>?</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">During my company's years of hyper-growth, I too succumbed to <strong>"scaling" more and more</strong>. More and more prospects, more and more customers, more and more partners, and so on. It worked well commercially.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">But, yes, there's a "but": I also contributed to the development of a company that was less like me. I wanted to get away from it. I wanted to start again with something that was more like me.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Instead, I gradually simplified and refocused my activities. Even if it meant generating less sales. <strong>To rediscover meaning and pleasure.</strong></p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Because infinite growth can also be achieved in unexpected ways: <strong>growth towards an activity that fits you better and better AND helps your customers better and better.</strong></p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">A good starting point is the <a href="{{ '/en/4-questions-eclairantes-pour-creer-votre-journee-ideale/' | relativeUrl }}" class="text-[#0A6BCE] hover:underline">ideal day exercise</a>. It's available on this page.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Does it resonate with you? Have you also fallen into the "scale or die" trap?</p>

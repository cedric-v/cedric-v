<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Illustration with an example from an entrepreneurial customer. The basic need: "I don't have enough subscribers to my newsletter to sell for X thousand euros/month." Identified during the session: - from Instagram, she has several profile links, including one to a LinkTree page with over 16 links - from her website, there are again a huge number of possibilities. - the newsletter sign-up form is hidden at the very bottom of a page (after loads of other info) and the need met by it is not expressed. In digital marketing in particular, it's extremely important that the next step is simple and clear. Otherwise, the reader closes the page. This customer will therefore simplify her Instagram profile link, her LinkTree page and her website. To have a simple, punchy and clear path. "Less is more". Have you ever been lost on a site, with the feeling of being drowned in a mass of information? What do you usually do in this situation?</p>

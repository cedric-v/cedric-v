<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Ever heard of the non-automatic list?</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Easily save decision-making time with the NOT to-do list.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Each human being has a sort of daily reservoir of energy linked to decision-making.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">And each time, in addition to tiring the brain, choosing also takes time.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">By the way, you've probably already heard the story of those famous people - CEOs, politicians, etc. - who dress the same way all the time in order to devote maximum energy to the things that are important to them. - dressing the same way all the time, so as to devote as much energy as possible to the things that are important to them.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">A few years ago, I recognized that I was systematically refusing certain things when I was asked to do them.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">But each time, by considering them anew.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⇒ By doing so, I was squandering my daily reservoir of decision-making resources.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Since I became aware of this, I've written a special list: the non-automatic list.</p>

**To illustrate this, here are a few points from this particular list:**

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">a) reject masked calls or calls from unidentified numbers</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">b) do not engage in angel investing</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">c) on the stock market, do not buy individual shares</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">d) refuse anything that doesn't feel YES</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">e) no MLM in any form.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Having made this list concrete helps me take the shortcut.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">In other words, to become aware of the situation more quickly.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Do you have things you don't do anyway, but which still require time to think about each time?</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Why not try the non-automatic list?</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It's also an easy way to simplify your life.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">And therefore free up time and energy for what really matters to us.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">What are the things that you systematically refuse, often after considerable thought?</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">(Is this the right time? Is this really a good idea? etc.).</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">---</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">If you discover me, I help entrepreneurs, freelancers and small business owners to boost their business while simplifying it.</p>

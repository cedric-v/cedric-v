<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Is being busy a sign of "success"? I'm dismantling a common misconception. With a business as illustration 👇</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">I spoke to an entrepreneur who, over the years, has set up increasingly complex systems.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">As I also did.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Complex means expensive to maintain - in time, money, energy and headaches...</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Frequent software updates, concerns about interoperability between different tools and services, ongoing training for the people who manage them, process adjustments and so on.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">So much so that it's easy to lose sight of what's at the heart of the business: its unique value proposition and how it can help your customers.</p>

### 💡 Success, however you define it, doesn't require complexity.

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">But it does require a clear vision, consistency and perseverance.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">When was the last time you thought "ah this stuff is too complicated"?</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Maybe it's time for a tune-up 😉</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">What came to mind? What part of your business could be simplified?</p>

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It was a customer's idea. Here's what we did instead. ⬇️</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">1️⃣ First and foremost, it's essential to have an offer that sells well. Most of the time, this is thanks to direct mail and interactivity.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">This first step enables you to understand and know your audience.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">So we relaunched a variant of his offer, correcting the objections initially identified.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">2️⃣ Once this first step has been validated, it's time to automate what has worked well, to see if it continues to do so, and if interactivity is still necessary.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">In our experience, the results of an evergreen offer are generally divided by 2, 3 or even 4 compared to an interactive launch.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">💡 If it didn't hit the mark on initial launch, then it's hard to automate and expect immediate profit.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">So we've revisited the popular parts of its launch, while integrating an asynchronous interactivity section.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">In other words, potential customers can leave comments and ask questions, while receiving an answer from the trainer.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">We are now monitoring the figures to validate the results and continue the continuous improvement process. 📈</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Do you have any automated sales offers?</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">What are your experiences in this area?</p>

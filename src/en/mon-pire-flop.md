<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">68,784 people contacted, 2,279 registered for a live event and... 0 sales. 😖 I'd missed the boat. The offer didn't sufficiently match the need of Instant Académie mailing list subscribers. Fortunately, I hadn't spent 6 months creating the online training before validating interest in it. With my team, we had only prepared "the red thread", i.e. enough elements to communicate about it, but no more. The first step was to validate the interest (or lack of it). There was some curiosity, i.e. people registered for the event and present at the live broadcast, but not much more... ➡️ Either we succeed in validating the offer, or we fail at an acceptable cost. In other words, a cost that doesn't jeopardize the company's survival. For this, there's nothing like proposing a simple first version, if possible co-created with the first customers. And if you don't get enough customers, you can develop the concept further, or even start from scratch. Has a new offer and 0 sales ever happened to you?</p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">I'd missed the boat. The offer didn't sufficiently match the need of Instant Académie mailing list subscribers.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Fortunately, I hadn't spent 6 months creating the online training before validating interest in it. With my team, we had only prepared <strong>"the red thread"</strong>, i.e. enough elements to communicate about it, but no more.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">The first step was to <strong>validate the interest (or lack of it)</strong>. There was some curiosity, i.e. people registered for the event and present at the live broadcast, but not much more...</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">➡️ <strong>Either we succeed in validating the offer, or we fail at an acceptable cost.</strong> In other words, a cost that doesn't jeopardize the company's survival.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">For this, there's nothing like proposing <strong>a simple first version</strong>, if possible co-created with the first customers. And if you don't get enough customers, you can develop the concept further, or even start from scratch.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Has a new offer and 0 sales ever happened to you?</p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">I understand the principle. I was even attracted to the term in my early days. <strong>The problem?</strong> It puts pressure on you. Unnecessarily.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>First of all, it's not quantifiable.</strong> And even if you do quantify it, the ego will always want more. That's the way it works. And it gets you nowhere.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>Secondly, one or even several "successes" don't necessarily lead to social recognition.</strong> Some people have achieved enormous things - discoveries that have improved the quality of life for millions, impressive territorial conquests, major artistic creations - while remaining unknown to the general public.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">What if there was another way? To <strong>"just" radiate who you are</strong> and help your customers with that?</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">By focusing on <strong>TODAY</strong>. On what you need right now. On <strong>WHO</strong> you can help even better. On a profitable business. On a business that's simple for you. And one that's right for you.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">No need to publish on every platform, all the time. It all starts with staying true to yourself. By carefully choosing where to put your time, money and energy. By acting with <a href="{{ '/en/la-confusion-mene-a-linaction-et-donc-a-labsence-de-ventes/' | relativeUrl }}" class="text-[#0A6BCE] hover:underline">clarity</a>, day after day.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It's a natural process. <strong>Feeling the pressure?</strong></p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Have you ever wanted to "make an impact"? How did it feel?</p>

**As Aurélien Morillon commented on one of my publications:**

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">I've found most of my customers through active recommendation.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Doing your job well, getting results, being recognized by your customers, that's one thing.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">But to find new ones without forcing the issue, you still have to know how to force your luck; in a world that's not as rational as you might hope.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">All it takes is a little humility, and the ability to ask your customers, face-to-face, without shame or fear, if they would be willing to recommend us to their friends and family, and if so, to whom.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Have you ever tried active recommendation?</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">If so, with what results?</p>

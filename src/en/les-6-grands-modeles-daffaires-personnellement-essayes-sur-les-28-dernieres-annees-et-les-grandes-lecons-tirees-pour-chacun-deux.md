          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE] mt-2 mb-2">💡 Traffic is easy to monetize.</h3>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ To increase or maintain visibility, it's necessary to produce attractive new content all the time.</p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed font-semibold"><strong>2️⃣ 2007-2012: Amazon affiliation (test products and earn commission on sales)</strong></p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE] mt-2 mb-2">💡 Easy and very passive.</h3>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ Very (too) dependent on external players (SEO and the platform that pays, in this case Amazon).</p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Not enough margin to buy advertising and boost the <a href="{{ '/en/focalise-toi-sur-les-systemes-plutot-que-sur-les-resultats10-systemes-pour-booster-ton-business/' | relativeUrl }}" class="text-[#0A6BCE] hover:underline">system</a>.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE] mt-2 mb-2">💡 Turning code into tangible value is quite an experience.</h3>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ Good marketing and strong brand creation are necessary because competition is tough.</p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Barriers to entry are falling rapidly as technology evolves.</p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Easy to start when you have the skills, more difficult to maintain over the medium-long term.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE] mt-2 mb-2">💡 Very powerful when you find the winning equation.</h3>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Very powerful when you manage to find the winning equation, allowing you to invest massively in advertising (📈 <strong>hypergrowth</strong>).</p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ However, this equation is not necessarily easy to find. It may require a lot of trial and error until you have a good enough offer (<strong>tip: test different angles of approach</strong>).</p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Promoting affiliate offers is a good way to get started and build partnerships.</p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">But it's not easy to run a business when the timing of cash flow depends too much on others. It's happened to me several times that I never got paid in the end. 😢</p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It is therefore preferable that the proportion of income generated by this means diminishes as the family grows, or even disappears altogether.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE] mt-2 mb-2">💡 Our knowledge network is important.</h3>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Around <strong>20% of bids finance the system</strong>.</p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ The e-learning market has become more difficult since the particularly high rise in inflation.</p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">This means that, even more than before, we need to quickly identify what works, in order to manage investments correctly.</p>

          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ I prefer to work with a small number of entrepreneurs over the medium-to-long term, rather than giving advice one after the other to a larger number.</p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">✨ As it happens, the short term often leads to more regular follow-up. So it's pertinent to keep a sufficiently accessible front door.</p>

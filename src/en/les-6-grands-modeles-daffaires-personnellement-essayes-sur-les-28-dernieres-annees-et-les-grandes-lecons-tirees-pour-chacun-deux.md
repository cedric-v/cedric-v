<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Here are the 6 major business models personally tried over the last 28 years and the major lessons learned for each.👇</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Perhaps some feedback can help you take a step back from your current business model.</p>

**Here are the ones we tried, in chronological order:**


**1️⃣ 1996-1999: selling advertising banners on my own media (video game website)**


### 💡 Traffic is easy to monetize.

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ To increase or maintain visibility, it's necessary to produce attractive new content all the time.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">2️⃣ 2007-2012: Amazon affiliation (test products and earn commission on sales)</p>

### 💡 Easy and very passive.

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ Very (too) dependent on external players (SEO and the platform that pays, in this case Amazon).</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Pas assez de marge pour acheter de la publicité et booster le <a href="{{ '/focalise-toi-sur-les-systemes-plutot-que-sur-les-resultats10-systemes-pour-booster-ton-business/' | relativeUrl }}" class="text-[#0A6BCE] hover:underline">système</a>.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Little sense.</p>

**3️⃣ 2009-2010 : SaaS (plateforme de conversion de fichiers en ligne)**


### 💡 Turning code into tangible value is quite an experience.

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ Good marketing and strong brand creation are necessary because competition is tough.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Barriers to entry are falling rapidly as technology evolves.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Easy to start when you have the skills, more difficult to maintain over the medium-long term.</p>

**4️⃣ 2012-2014 : vente de formations en ligne en direct et en affiliation**

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Very powerful when you manage to find the winning equation, allowing you to invest massively in advertising ( 📈 hypergrowth).</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ However, this equation is not necessarily easy to find. It may require a lot of trial and error until you have a good enough offer (tip: test different angles of approach).</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Promoting affiliate offers is a good way to get started and build partnerships.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">But it's not easy to run a business when the timing of cash flow depends too much on others. It's happened to me several times that I never got paid in the end. 😢</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It is therefore preferable that the proportion of income generated by this means diminishes as the family grows, or even disappears altogether.</p>

**5️⃣ 2015-today: online training publishing-distribution company.**


### 💡Our knowledge network is important.

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Around 20% of bids finance the system.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵ The e-learning market has become more difficult since the particularly high rise in inflation.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">This means that, even more than before, we need to quickly identify what works, in order to manage investments correctly.</p>

**6️⃣ 2016-today: consulting-mentoring business**


### 💡Helping others to <a href="{{'/en/accompagnement/individuel/' | relativeUrl }}" class="text-[#0A6BCE] hover:underline">develop and/or simplify their business</a> is super interesting.

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">⤵I prefer to work with a small number of entrepreneurs over the medium-to-long term, rather than giving advice one after the other to a larger number.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">✨ As it happens, the short term often leads to more regular follow-up. So it's pertinent to keep a sufficiently accessible front door.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">And what business models have you tried?</p>

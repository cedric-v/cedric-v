      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>1) Your instinct is your ally.</strong> If you don't feel something, don't do it.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>2) The best fight is the one you don't have to fight.</strong> Anticipate what you can. Take care of your health first.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>3) Avoid violence.</strong> But if you have to defend yourself, then do it. Act or don't act, there's no in-between. Make a decision, then move on.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>4) Anchoring is essential.</strong> To be inattentive is to risk your life. Feel your body fully, in your belly and your base. Breathe deeply. Then realize what's relevant and essential now.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>5) Surprise is powerful.</strong> In a modern world driven by attention-grabbing, being able to surprise is particularly useful. Arousing curiosity can help you do this in your communications.</p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>And one last bonus (surprise! 😁):</strong></p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>6) Learn to fall better and get up faster.</strong> Someone who has mastered a subject is one who has made almost every possible mistake about it. Failure is part of learning.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Do any of these lessons speak to you in particular?</p>

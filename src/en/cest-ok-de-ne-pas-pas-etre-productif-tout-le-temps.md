<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Guilt-free article. 🌈</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Our society values being busy all the time.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It turns out that being busy is different from being productive.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">And the two are often confused.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Because while it's easy to be busy, it's much harder to be productive.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">And the gap is even wider when the thing to be produced requires our full attention.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">In this case, you need to feel good enough first.</p>

**To do this :**

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">1️⃣ it's OK to reorganize your day when you're feeling too tired or when you have unexpected events to deal with.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">2️⃣ It's also OK to take regular breaks.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">For greater well-being and a better start.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It's not humanly possible to be productive all the time.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It's part of the way our bodies work.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">So we might as well make it part of our daily routine, so that we can keep it up over the long term.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">And to be more frequently and easily "in the flow" of productivity. ☀</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">What tips do you have on this subject?</p>

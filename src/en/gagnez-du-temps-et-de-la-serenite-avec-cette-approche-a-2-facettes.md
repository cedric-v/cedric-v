<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">For several years now, I've adopted a simple but effective method: I divide my weeks into half-days, alternating between management time and creative moments.</p>

**Here's how it works:**


**1) Management time includes :**

- Calls with colleagues, partners and (future) customers
- Administrative management
- And all the little tasks required to keep the company running smoothly.

**2) Creation time includes :**

- Content creation (for customers, public communications, etc.)
- The introduction of new offers
- Time to reflect on the overall approach and the improvements to be made
- Fundamental work that makes the company evolve.
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Separating my half-days into management and creative moments allows me to work serenely and efficiently.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">This allows all calls to be grouped together during defined periods, freeing up uninterrupted time to get on with what is not urgent but necessary for the company's development.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Have you ever tried this way of dividing up your weeks?</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">✅ If so, what are the benefits for you?</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">❓Otherwise, what other approach works well for you?</p>

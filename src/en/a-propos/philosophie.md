    <!-- The Paradox of the Heart-Centered Entrepreneur -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE]">The paradox of the heart-centered entrepreneur</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
        <p>
          You started out of passion, driven by a strong vision and the desire to contribute with meaning. Yet the path has led you to a common paradox: your activity, once a source of clarity and energy, may have become heavy and rigid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like stagnant water, the business accumulates tensions: mental overload, excessive management, race to complex strategies. You spend more time "coordinating" and "running in all directions" than realizing the profound impact that animates you. You're at the head of an organization that, little by little, no longer corresponds to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          This feeling of misalignment is not a failure, it's a signal. It's the call of body and mind to regain natural movement. This is where the Fluance approach takes root.

    <!-- The evidence of feeling: less = more -->

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE]">The evidence of feeling: less = more</h2>
      <div class="space-y-4 text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
        <p>
          After experiencing hypergrowth (with Instant Académie and over 40,000 courses sold), I myself reached this point of saturation. I had accumulated, but I had lost the essential: fluidity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The greatest lesson from this journey is that <strong>complexity is the enemy of lasting impact</strong>. The Fluance philosophy is a commitment to regain joyful and aligned efficiency: <strong>less = more</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your business can function as a living and balanced system, capable of reacting to changes without unnecessary tension.

          For this, the coaching unfolds across three fundamental axes, merging intuition and engineering rigor:

            <p class="text-[#0f172a]/80 leading-relaxed">
              Before acting, we stop running. We gain perspective to identify what exhausts you and what truly nourishes you. It's the return to awareness of your ideal business model.
            </p>

            <p class="text-[#0f172a]/80 leading-relaxed">
              We move from heaviness to lightness. It's about restructuring and simplifying your organization so it becomes a tool at the service of your mission, and not the other way around.

            We identify, clarify and highlight what you offer that's unique and profound. We make it accessible, fair and commercially viable, while respecting your values and feelings.

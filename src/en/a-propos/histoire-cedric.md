      Engineer, entrepreneur, trainer, and now also a coach for heart-centered leaders. My path has not been a straight line, but a succession of necessary transformations to align who I am with what I do.
    </p>
    <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE]">
      Here are the 5 steps that led me to create the Fluance Pro approach.
    </p>
  </div>

  <article class="max-w-none space-y-12 text-[#1f1f1f]">
    <!-- Step 1 -->
    <div class="section-card p-8 bg-white space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE]">1. The technical foundation and the call of meaning</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
        Everything started with a "classic" but solid path. Trained as a computer engineer, I spent 10 years in the industry, evolving from developer to product manager, then project manager. I had structure, logic and skills. Yet, a void persisted. I no longer found meaning in what I was doing, nor for whom I was doing it. This inner gap pushed me to look elsewhere, to explore consciousness and the return to self.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Step 2 -->
    <div class="section-card p-8 bg-white space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE]">2. The first pivot: digitizing the intangible</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
        In 2012, I decided to listen to this search for meaning. I made a radical shift to become a meditation trainer. But my technical background didn't leave me: I wanted to make this practice accessible to as many people as possible through digital means. This was the birth of Instant Méditation. At a time when online wellness was in its infancy, I managed to reach several thousand people, proving that spirituality and digital tools could be combined.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Step 3 -->
    <div class="section-card p-8 bg-white space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE]">3. The meteoric rise and complexity</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
        Step by step, in 2015, I aimed higher. I created Instant Académie, a platform to connect authentic experts with their audience. The numbers followed: <strong>over 40,000 courses sold</strong>, <strong>541 webinars hosted</strong> and clients in <strong>35 countries</strong>.<br><br>
        I massively reinvested over several years (nearly 100,000 CHF) to train with the best in marketing and communication. But this growth had a price. I experienced roller coasters: six-figure revenues followed by periods of intense stress, a structure that became heavy, and a frantic race to management that distanced me from myself, from what contributes to my joy.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Step 4 -->
    <div class="section-card p-8 bg-white space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE]">4. The saturation point and return to essentials</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
        This is the step that many entrepreneurs dread but which is salvific. I reached a saturation point. I had the knowledge, I had the "success", but I had lost clarity. I realized that wanting to "do everything right" and accumulating complex strategies had cut me off from my feelings.<br><br>
        I then made a transition that lasted three years to restructure, simplify and integrate a fundamental lesson: <strong>"Less = More"</strong>. I understood that profitability should not come at the expense of what matters most (couple, family, respecting one's values and feelings, etc.).

    <!-- Step 5 -->
    <div class="section-card p-8 bg-white space-y-4">
      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold text-[#0A6BCE]">5. Transmission: Fluance and alignment</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#0f172a]/80">
        Today, strengthened by <strong>{{ "2012-03-01" | yearsSince }} years of experience</strong> and <strong>50 entrepreneurs already coached</strong>, I founded <a href="https://fluance.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#0A6BCE] hover:underline font-semibold">Fluance for individuals, focused on body movement</a>, and Fluance Pro, presented on this site. It's the synthesis of my journey: the rigor of the engineer combined with the intuition of the facilitator.<br><br>
        With Fluance Pro, I now help heart-centered entrepreneurs avoid repeating my mistakes by going straight to the essentials. I guide you to structure your business model, value your uniqueness and regain an activity that nourishes you instead of exhausting you.

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It's still all too often a taboo subject. But yes, efficiency and quality are also linked to well-being.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Moderate, occasional stress can help you focus.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">But when it's almost all the time and too intense, it usually has the opposite effect.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">When we suffer from fatigue, overwork or headaches, are we in a state of being that favors focus and quality? Of course not.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Well, this is what many people experience on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Regular breaks are therefore essential to refocus, to feel your body and your breathing.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Then be ready to identify what's important now. Then move on.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Of course, this applies to everyone.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">For entrepreneurs/managers/executives, the effect of this is often even greater. When our choices have a leverage effect. And directly influence others.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Regular refocusing is therefore important. For yourself and those around you.</p>
<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">How do you take care of yourself and improve your focus?</p>

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">We are creatures of habit. And I'm one of them. In fact, it's easier for me to set aside a small time slot each day to write, than to write a week's worth of content in one morning. I call it "every day, without pressure" because: 1) I sit back and let the inspiration of the moment flow. If nothing comes after 2-3 minutes, I move on to my next important task, planned the day before. 2) If, on the other hand, the process flows smoothly, it's off to the writing ✨ This allows me to publish regularly, without it seeming like a mountain. And when it's not time, too bad. That's for another day. And for you, what works well? Planning content for the whole week? On the spur of the moment, at a particular frequency?</p>

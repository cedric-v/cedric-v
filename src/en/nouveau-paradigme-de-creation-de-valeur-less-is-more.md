      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>"Less is more"</strong> 💡 The new way of creating value.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">When I started offering online training in 2012, value creation involved access to a complete course with <strong>as much qualitative content as possible</strong>. If it was spread over several months, it was more valuable than over a shorter period. If there were more videos, the same.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Today, the dynamic has changed. 🌓 <strong>The amount of information created every minute is dizzying.</strong> 😮</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">🌈 It's now a matter of providing <strong>the fastest path that meets the need</strong>.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">On principle, this was already the case before, you'll tell me. It's true. It's a basic principle. ✅ In practice, however, <strong>it's even more necessary than before.</strong> ✨</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">The more information we're drowning in, <strong>the more valuable the relevance of a key piece of information</strong>. In a way, it's like helping to find the needle in a haystack.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">That is, access to <strong>the optimal information of the moment</strong>, directly applicable to one's current situation (or that of one's company).</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Have you also noticed this evolution? If so, how do you go about meeting your customers' needs even better with the <strong>"less is more"</strong> principle?</p>

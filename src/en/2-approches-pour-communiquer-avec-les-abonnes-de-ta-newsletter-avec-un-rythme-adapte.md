<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">One with 2 speeds and the other simpler, but less flexible in some cases. 💭 I start from the following premise: 😀 A mailing list subscriber is OK with receiving lots of e-mails, as long as the subject is of current interest to him. 😥 Otherwise he either unsubscribes, or files your mails in a folder that is (almost) never read. To respect this, there are 2 main approaches: 1) Communicate punctually and more with subscribers who react to a topic. This is the Instant Académie approach: every week, a topic is featured, and when a subscriber clicks on an e-mail about it, they receive the rest. Someone expressing interest will therefore receive many more messages on this subject, during a short period, following their mark of interest. ➕ it's easy to organize a launch sequence to interested parties (and avoid being pushy with uninterested people) ➖ requires a bit of technique to manage the segmentation process 2) Communicate at the same rhythm for everyone This rhythm is to be clarified, generally, it's daily, (bi-)weekly, or (bi-)monthly. ➕ rhythm all the time identical and predictable, like a newspaper or magazine ➖ if the rhythm isn't sustained enough (daily or bi-weekly), it's difficult to create the closing effect of a launch (usually generating between 30 and 50% of sales). What's your preferred approach? At the same time, please specify whether your answer concerns you as a subscriber or as a distributor (as this changes perception 😉 ). Do you have a different approach to the two presented here? If so, I look forward to hearing from you in the comments.</p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">You've found what you do naturally, almost effortlessly, <strong>AND that's valuable to your customers</strong>? Well, bravo! This is precisely the <strong>"sweet spot"</strong> as the English say.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">It's part of your <a href="{{ '/en/avez-vous-clairement-identifie-votre-unicite-et-celle-de-votre-activitebusiness/' | relativeUrl }}" class="text-[#0A6BCE] hover:underline">uniqueness</a>. It's what sets you apart. That you can capitalize on. And pay you.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed"><strong>What's simple for you isn't necessarily simple for others.</strong> It's something that attracts you without you necessarily knowing why. And that you've therefore trained more than most. Perhaps even without realizing it...</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">Now you can help your customers with this skill. And therefore get paid for doing something you enjoy <strong>AND that's easy for you.</strong> Yeahh! 🎉</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">What do you do with ease (skill, creation, etc.) that is of value to others?</p>

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">If you'd like help simplifying your business to refocus on your uniqueness, contact me via the contact form or via WhatsApp.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">If you've identified what's easy for you and valuable to others, but are struggling to get regular customers, I can help too.</p>
